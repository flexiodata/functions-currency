# Currency Conversion Spreadsheet Functions

These currency conversion functions enable you to list currency rates and convert currency amounts in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. These functions utilize the [European Central Bank exchange rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io) for current and historical foreign exchange rates and [Flex.io](https://www.flex.io) to run the functions and return the results to the spreadsheet. See the [function documentation](https://www.flex.io/integrations/currency#functions-and-syntax) for a list of the functions available and the spreadsheet syntax to use them.
